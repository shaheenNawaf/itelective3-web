**GAKUSEI** is built on the idea of further modernizing the monitoring systems for Students to ensure that they safe and in-campus during their set class schedule.
Basically, we are your online nanny! ðŸ˜†

Why "Gakusei" - it's student in Japanese and it sounds cool! ðŸ¤£

## Project History
Typical attendance monitoring systems usually involve pen and paper, making record keeping, making and updating really tedious to do.

Now with our desktop app- **Gakusei**, all of those tediousness are now solved with a more modernized approach to attendance monitoring systems. 
Allowing universities to have a more centralized database to store all the necessary information with relation to keeping track of the attendance of their students which makes it timely during this era of Online Classes.

This application features 2 kinds of modes, mainly one for the Admin and Faculty where they can access, edit and remove high-level information while students get to see and be updated with their attendance.
